# control_path_dir = /tmp/.ansible/cp
#!!!control_path_dir = ~/.ssh/

# The path to use for the ControlPath sockets. This defaults to a hashed string of the hostname,
# port and username (empty string in the config). The hash mitigates a common problem users
# found with long hostames and the conventional %(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r format.
# In those cases, a "too long for Unix domain socket" ssh error would occur.

# By default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with
# sudoers configurations that have requiretty (the default on many distros).
